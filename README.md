# LunarisMC Discord Bot

Hey everyone, development team from LunarisMC here!

This is the Discord Bot we use in our server, we decided to open source it to give something back to the community! 

This bot is not designed for public use, you may edit everything. This repo is just intended as a starting point for starting Java developers! 

We hope we were able to help your journey!

Do we offer support for this repo? Yes! We do, just send a message to me (Kippie) on Discord! I will be happy to help you and explain how we coded this and what the code really does!
